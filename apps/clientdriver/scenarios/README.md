<!-- Project Ambrose by Imjustchico: A catalog of client-driver scenarios and the repeatable checks each one performs. -->

# Client-driver scenario catalog

The client driver loads one JSON file at a time from this directory. The files
listed below are the repeatable checks that cover the C-03 scenario set. They
share the disposable-account, local-server, and private-capture requirements
described in [the safe-session capture guide](../../../doc/guides/safe-session-capture.md).

## C-03 coverage

| Check | Scenario | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Idle timeout | [`c39-idle-timeout.json`](./c39-idle-timeout.json) | A bounded `Login.AfkTimeout` closes an idle admitted session and records the server-side AFK disconnect. |
| Ban enforcement | [`c39-ban-enforcement.json`](./c39-ban-enforcement.json) | A console-applied account ban closes the admitted session and produces a refused-login response on the next attempt. |
| Reconnect after refusal | [`c39-reconnect-after-refusal.json`](./c39-reconnect-after-refusal.json) | A wrong password, invalid-login dialog, reconnect action, and successful retry occur in that order. |
| Shutdown notice | [`c39-shutdown-notice.json`](./c39-shutdown-notice.json) | A graceful login-server shutdown emits both the server notice and the client maintenance notice. |

The files retain their original C-39 scenario names because they are also
individual regression checks. This catalog groups them under C-03 without
changing their executable behavior or asserting that a run passed without a
client and local server.

## Login and character select

| Check | Scenario | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Banned before sign-in | [`c77-banned-login.json`](./c77-banned-login.json) | 2.14's banned account: `account ban` on the login server console before the account first signs in, the server's refusal with AccountBanned, the client choosing GUI_AccountBannedTime and a shot of its dialog, and neither the client's admission nor character select ever logged. |
| AFK on character select | [`c78-afk-character-select.json`](./c78-afk-character-select.json) | 2.15's AFK check: a seeded wizard left on character select past a 150-second `Login.AfkTimeout`, the server's MSG_DISCONNECT_LOGIN_AFK, and the client choosing GUI_ConnectionAFK with no lost-connection message, with shots before the timeout and of the dialog. |
| Idle at the login prompt | [`c79-idle-login-keepalive.json`](./c79-idle-login-keepalive.json) | 1.22's idle check: after a wrong password, the client held at the login retry prompt with `Login.AfkTimeout` raised to 600, through six keepalive cycles each way at a 60-second `Network.KeepAliveInterval`, over five minutes, with the session never closed and the account never authenticated. |

C-78 also requires the game server, which the driver starts; C-77 and C-79 run
against the login server alone.

| Check | Scenario | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Three wizards listed | [`charselect-three-wizards.json`](./charselect-three-wizards.json) | 3.09: three wizards seeded on one account with `more_wizards`, a level 1 Fire boy, a level 12 Ice girl and a level 25 Storm boy, listed by the server, each chosen in turn and shot under its own name, level and school. |
| Creating at the limit | [`create-at-slot-limit.json`](./create-at-slot-limit.json) | 3.12, 3.15 and 3.16: `Character.MaxPerAccount` at 1 with one wizard seeded, the client's creation flow walked with a shot of each screen, the submitted wizard refused with the reason logged, the client's "Character Creation Failed", and the account still holding one wizard. |
| Deleting a wizard | [`delete-a-wizard.json`](./delete-a-wizard.json) | 3.17: two wizards seeded, the first deleted with the client's own dialog, its word ABRACADABRA typed and its Delete pressed, the row kept with deleted_at set, and after the client restarts and logs in again only the other wizard is listed and shown. |
| A key that cannot be spent | [`attach-bad-key.json`](./attach-bad-key.json) | 4.06: a `db_exec` trigger spoils every key the login server stores, so the game server refuses the MSG_ATTACH the client sends with MSG_ATTACHFAILED, and the client is shot over its login screen. |

## World entry

| Check | Scenario | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standing in Ravenwood | [`enter-world.json`](./enter-world.json) | A wizard saved in WizardCity/WC_Ravenwood is listed, played and handed its object in MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE, the client loads the zone and says so, the entry chatter is answered, and the session stays up through a keepalive. |
| Announcing and kicking | [`announce-and-kick.json`](./announce-and-kick.json) | The Commons entry, then `server announce` on the game server console, whose text the client shows as a notification and logs as a server message, and `kick` with the wizard's character id, which sends the reason CSR and opens the client's dialog for a disconnect by an administrator. |
| Walking in the Commons | [`enter-the-commons.json`](./enter-the-commons.json) | The same entry for a wizard saved in WizardCity/WC_Hub with no position, placed at the zone's Start, with the fields MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE carried recorded, and a held W that moves the view far more than the same time idle, which is the player controlling the wizard. |
| Walking away and back | [`walk-and-return.json`](./walk-and-return.json) | The Commons entry, a walk with W, then the client quits and is started again under the same guard; the game server writes where the wizard stood as it leaves, and the second login must put the wizard back at exactly that place, which differs from the zone's Start it first stood at. |
| Game-server shutdown and return | [`game-server-shutdown-and-return.json`](./game-server-shutdown-and-return.json) | Stops the game server while a wizard is connected, records the flushed MSG_SERVERSHUTDOWN notice and the client's screen, starts the server again, and requires the wizard to re-enter at the exact previously saved position. |
| Badges and a long frame | [`badges-and-long-frame.json`](./badges-and-long-frame.json) | 3.02, 4.11 and 1.18: the Ravenwood entry with the game server saving the LOGINCOMPLETE Data it sends and decoding it at DEBUG, MSG_BADGES logged and the spellbook's Badges page opened and shot, then `server announce --repeat 16` sends a message of about 32000 bytes in one long frame, which the client logs whole. |
| A wizard's live vitals | [`wizard-stats.json`](./wizard-stats.json) | A level 5 game master enters Ravenwood with stored health, mana and gold; the HUD, backpack and character-stats screen record those stored values before any changes. Then `.character gold 500` updates the open backpack, two potion uses at different live `Potion.RestoreFraction` values update health, mana and charges, and `.character heal` restores health with the animated update; the final character-stats screen records the values after those live changes. |
| Learning a spell | [`learn-a-spell.json`](./learn-a-spell.json) | A Fire wizard with an empty spellbook enters Ravenwood; `learn "Fire Cat" <wizard>` on the game server console sends MSG_ADDSPELLTOBOOK and a second learn is refused, the spellbook opened with P is shot on its Fire page before and after, the client is quit and started again and the wizard must enter knowing Fire Cat, and `unlearn` sends MSG_REMOVESPELLFROMBOOK before a last shot. The Spell Deck shows no card for a wizard without a deck, so the Fire page stays empty until 8.10 and 8.11 give it one. |
| A hat in the backpack, then trashed | [`backpack-add-and-trash.json`](./backpack-add-and-trash.json) | 8.08: a game master's empty backpack shows 0 of the 100 items `Inventory.Slots` gives; `.additem 1652259` in chat stores the Balance hat and the backpack shows its row and 1 of 100, and holding the pointer on the row shows its tooltip under the client's name for it; the row, the trash can and YES in the client's own dialog trash it, its row is deleted, and after the client is quit and started again the backpack is still empty. The client must load every item it is sent. |
| A locked hat survives a relog | [`backpack-lock.json`](./backpack-lock.json) | 8.09: the client's own Backpack Item Lock setting, on the fourth gameplay page, is turned to YES and stored with the wizard, which shows the lock button in the backpack; the button locks the hat `.additem 1652259` gave, the row shows a padlock and the trash can greys out and asks nothing when pressed; after the client is quit and started again the hat is still locked and in the backpack rather than worn, and the button unlocks it so the trash can and YES take it out for good. |
| Two wizards | [`two-wizards.json`](./two-wizards.json) | A second client, the companion, enters the Commons on an account and wizard of its own after the main wizard has backed away from the Start; the companion opens and closes its spellbook while the main client records the icon appearing and clearing, then turns to face the main wizard, runs a circle with W and D held together, stops and jumps while the main client is filmed every quarter second, then quits and comes back, and must be taken away from the main wizard at once and come back with a new mobile id as one wizard, not a ghost. |
| Speaking and emoting | [`say-and-emote.json`](./say-and-emote.json) | Two wizards as in two-wizards.json, the companion showing its chat box: the main wizard types hello, which its client sends as the menu phrase Hello that waves, then a typed line the companion sees as a bubble and a chat log line under the main wizard's own name, and `.help`, which nobody is shown. From the quick chat menu it picks Yes, then Hi from the Hello/Goodbye category while the companion is filmed waving. `Chat.SayRange` and `GM.CommandPrefix` changed on the game server console apply from the next line. |
| Friends and ignoring | [`friends-and-ignore.json`](./friends-and-ignore.json) | 12.01 and 12.02: the main wizard clicks the companion and adds it as a friend through the client's own card and question, the companion accepts its popup, both friendships are stored and each friends list shows the other online, and each client's Teleport question names the friend's zone, The Commons; the companion quits from its menu and the main client is told and shows it offline; after it returns and speaks, the main wizard ignores it from its card, the ignore is stored and its next line is shown to nobody. |
| Game master commands in chat | [`gm-commands-in-chat.json`](./gm-commands-in-chat.json) | The main account is made a game master on the login server's console, and two wizards enter the Commons. The game master types `.spell info Fire Cat`, whose reply is captured in `main-spell-info-fire-cat`, then `.help`, whose command list comes back in chat while the companion sees no bubble. The companion's own `.help` is said as a line, then refused once `GM.PlayerCommandsAsChat` is off. With `GM.LogCommands` off a command still answers but is not logged, and the next command after it is back on is. |
| Bans, restores and chat marks | [`gm-ban-and-restore.json`](./gm-ban-and-restore.json) | The companion account is given menu chat only and the main one made a game master before either logs in; the main wizard sees the filtered balloon beside the companion's name, then bans the companion in chat, which is disconnected as banned and refused at its next login, unbans it, and restores its wizard after it was deleted, which is back on its select screen after a relog, in 6.05. |
| Teleports in a zone | [`gm-teleport.json`](./gm-teleport.json) | A game master walks away in the Commons and types `.tele Start`, snapping to the fountain with no loading screen while the companion sees it pop there; `.gps` prints its place; a point it adds with `.tele add` works at once before `.tele del` removes it, in 6.06. |
| Zone transfer | [`gm-zone-transfer.json`](./gm-zone-transfer.json) | A game master's `.tele zone` to a path the server does not hold is refused; `.tele zone WizardCity/WC_Ravenwood` takes it out of the Commons, which the companion sees, through the loading screen to Ravenwood's Start on a single-use transfer key, in 6.07. |
| Walk-in volumes | [`zone-volumes.json`](./zone-volumes.json) | A wizard arrives in the Commons inside its home volume and walks about there with no enter fired; put just outside Ravenwood's POI facing each quarter turn, it walks in, and the server logs `Enter_Ravenwood POI` firing `Trigger POI Ravenwood`, in 6.13. |
| Zone doors | [`zone-doors.json`](./zone-doors.json) | The game master walks through the Commons' Ravenwood gate, through the loading screen into Ravenwood, and back to `Target location(WC_Hub Ravenwood)`; into the Headmistress House and out; and, after its row is edited in the world database and `.reload zone_teleport` runs, through the house entrance to the new place, after `.zone teleports` lists the Commons' doors and a row naming a missing zone is refused at a reload that keeps the old doors. Zone.DoorsIgnoreRequirements lets the gated Ravenwood gate pass, and Updates.AllowPending applies the pending zone_teleport SQL |
| Area of interest | [`aoi-walk-away.json`](./aoi-walk-away.json) | With Visibility.Distance at 400, the companion backs away until the main wizard loses sight of it and walks back until it is shown again where it stands, and the server names the Commons' objects exempt from area of interest, in 6.16. |
| Spawning an NPC | [`npc-spawn-and-delete.json`](./npc-spawn-and-delete.json) | 9.04: two wizards in the Commons, the companion facing the game master, who types `.npc spawn 38232`; both clients are shot with Simeon standing beside it, then `.npc delete` takes the nearest spawned object away and both are shot again without it. |
| Spawns from a trigger | [`duel-arena-respawn.json`](./duel-arena-respawn.json) | 9.04: a game master's `.tele zone WizardCity/WC_Duel_Arena`; on entering, the arena's EnterZone triggers run their ResSpawn results, switching on the GoodGuy and BadGuy spawners that start inactive, and the game server logs what they spawned. |
| Path patrols | [`path-patrol.json`](./path-patrol.json) | 10.14: two game masters enter Unicorn Way, whose spawner entries stand on nodes of their paths, and `.go xyz` beside Path Ghost02; each client is shot five times about two seconds apart, so the same ghost is seen at the same place on both as it walks. The main wizard then travels to the Commons and goes beside the mana wisps' Path 86, showing its wisps and reagents on their nodes rather than at the origin; no walker stops on a broken path and neither client fails to load one. |
| Game effects | [`effect-show-and-clear.json`](./effect-show-and-clear.json) | Two wizards as in gm-commands-in-chat.json, the companion facing the main wizard: `effect add PostCombatEffect <wizard>` on the game server console sends MSG_ADDEFFECT to both clients, which are shot, and `effect remove 1 <wizard>` sends MSG_REMOVEEFFECT before both are shot again; then the same with BearBallerinaTransformation. Neither client may fail to load the effect or find its template. |
| Link-dead expiry | [`two-wizards-link-dead-expiry.json`](./two-wizards-link-dead-expiry.json) | Includes the two-wizard reattach check, then ends the resumed companion's process again and verifies the main wizard receives its removal after the 300-second link-dead window. |
| Menu logout | [`two-wizards-menu-logout.json`](./two-wizards-menu-logout.json) | Includes the two-wizard and link-dead reattach checks, then chooses Quit in the companion's in-world menu, verifies immediate removal and saved position, stops the client's retry of its spent zone ticket, and requires a fresh login at that exact position. |
| A full realm's queue | [`realm-queue.json`](./realm-queue.json) | 12.21: two clients as in two-wizards.json; with the main wizard in the Commons the realm's `player_limit` is set to 1 and read back on a one-second `Realm.RefreshInterval`, the companion's Play is queued at position 1 and photographed twice while the client shows its verifying-character wait, and when the main wizard quits from its in-world menu the companion is sent to the realm with a fresh key by itself and stands in the Commons. |
| Return to character select | [`return-to-select.json`](./return-to-select.json) | The Ravenwood entry of enter-world.json, a walk with W, then Quit from the in-world menu; the client validates its stored session key with MSG_USER_VALIDATE and lands on character select with no password typed, the wizard is offline with its zone saved and gone from `realm_online_character`, and Play puts it back at the exact place the game server wrote, in 5.06. |
| Equip and unequip | [`equip-gear.json`](./equip-gear.json) | Two Fire wizards in the Commons; the main one gets WC1-Hat-Tier1 by `.additem`, double-clicks its row to wear it, and its row, paper doll and own view change while the companion sees the hat in the same color as the wearer, which the public entry only gives when it is a WizardEquippedItemInfo; the hat is still worn after the main client is quit and started again, and double-clicking it puts it back in the backpack, in 8.10. |

All world-entry scenarios require the game server as well as the login server; the driver starts them. A step names the client it drives with `"client": "companion"`, `kill_client` ends that client's process without its logout path, `stop_game_server` and `start_game_server` bracket a graceful game-server restart, `hold_key` holds a list of keys together, `hover` holds the pointer on a target for `settle` seconds and shoots what the client shows there, such as a tooltip, `drag` presses the button on `target`, moves the pointer in `steps` moves to `to` and lets go there, as an item is dragged onto a slot, `play` hands the client to whoever is at the machine and holds the run, servers and databases up until the client window is closed, which play.json uses to put a level 25 Fire wizard in the Commons for the maintainer, a held key or a press may `watch` the other client, which is filmed every `watch_every` seconds while the key is held or the press made and for `watch_after` seconds after, `compare_shots` says whether a `region` of two earlier shots, named by their `file`, `differ`s or `match`es, with `fraction` the share of pixels that must agree, and `compare_colors` reads the hue of what changed between two shots in `first_region` and between two others in `second_region` and fails when they are more than `degrees` apart, which is how equip-gear.json holds the wearer's view of a hat and the companion's to the same color.

## Patching

| Check | Scenario | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No patch connection with -P 0 | [`patch-off.json`](./patch-off.json) | The launcher's client, started with `-P 0` from a run folder holding the install's own `PatchConfig.xml` pointed at a live local listener, shows the login window and logs in while that listener and one on 12500 see no connection and the guard sees nothing off the machine, with no patcher line in the client's log. |
| The default without -P | [`patch-default.json`](./patch-default.json) | The client started from the launcher's own prepared command with only `-P 0` taken out, so it follows its own default, with the install's own `PatchConfig.xml` in its folder pointed at a local listener; the client connecting to that listener shows it contacts the patch host its configuration names by default, while the guard keeps every connection on this machine and the install check proves nothing on disk changed. |
| Zoning in with -P 0 and the live switches | [`patch-off-zone-in.json`](./patch-off-zone-in.json) | 16.07: the client started with `-P 0` and its `PatchConfig.xml` pointed at a live local listener enters Ravenwood with `Patch.Enabled` turned on live, while the game server's packet log, filtered to the package download messages and MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE, shows the login complete and no package download; `.settings set Patch.Enabled 0` then holds through a `.tele zone` transfer to the Commons with none sent either, and `.settings set Login.EnforceRevision 1` on the running login server, with `Login.AllowedRevision` naming no real client, refuses the next login after a client restart for its revision. Neither patch port sees a connection. |

## Launcher

| Check | Scenario | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Play from the launcher window | [`launcher-window-play.json`](./launcher-window-play.json) | 3.26: the launcher opened with `--window-ui` shows the run's server as host:port, the client's revision, the window size and the login server Online on its ready screen and the install the driver found, `{install}`, on its settings screen, read through UI Automation, then its Play, pressed by its accessible name, starts the client as the launcher's child with a client area of the run's window size, and the client reaches its login window. |

`launch: "window"` cannot be combined with `patching: "default"`, a companion
or `restart_client`, because the window starts one client and only its Play
starts it.

## Listing and running

List the scenarios without starting a client or server:

```powershell
python apps\clientdriver\drive.py scenarios
```

Run one check with a user-owned client, locally built binaries, and a run
directory outside the repository:

```powershell
python apps\clientdriver\drive.py run `
  --scenario c39-idle-timeout.json `
  --binaries C:\Path\To\Ambrose\build\windows-msvc-x64\bin\RelWithDebInfo `
  --client C:\Path\To\Your\Client `
  --runs C:\Temp\ambrose-clientdriver
```

Replace the scenario name for the other rows. The run directory contains the
private report, logs, and (unless `--no-capture` is explicitly selected) the
private `login.pcapng` and `.tshark.txt` files. Do not copy those artifacts
into this directory or into the repository.

## Boundaries

- These scenarios require the driver preflight to succeed; an unavailable
  client, capture adapter, or required helper is a prerequisite limitation,
  not a failed protocol assertion.
- The scenario runner creates its disposable account and scratch databases
  according to the selected server options. Do not provide a real account or
  a production database.
- A scenario's recorded logs and capture remain private. Public reports may
  cite only non-sensitive metadata such as the scenario name, result, frame
  count, and failure step.
